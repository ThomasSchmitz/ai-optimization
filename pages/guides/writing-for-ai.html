                    Writing for AI is fundamentally different from traditional web copywriting or even traditional SEO 
                    writing. AI models don't just scan for keywords—they understand context, extract meaning, and 
                    evaluate authority. Your writing must be clear, direct, and structured in ways that AI can easily 
                    parse and confidently cite.

                <p class="section-intro">
                    Traditional web copywriting prioritizes persuasion, personality, and conversion. SEO writing focuses 
                    on keyword optimization and ranking signals. Writing for AI requires a third approach: clarity, 
                    authority, and structure optimized for machine understanding.

                    <p>
                        AI doesn't "visit" your page—it extracts and synthesizes information from it. Unlike human visitors 
                        who can navigate, scroll, and click for more information, AI needs everything accessible in clear, 
                        parseable text. Write as if you're answering a question for an extremely literal, intelligent friend 
                        who can't see images, can't click links, and needs the complete answer right now.
