                    E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) is Google's quality framework

                    become crucial for AI platforms that need to assess source credibility when selecting content to cite 
                    and reference in their responses.

                </p>

                <h3>1. Document Real-World Experience</h3>
                <div class="info-box">

                    <ul>

                    Writing in first-person ("I," "we," "our") when appropriate signals direct experience.
