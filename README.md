## AI Requirements & Documentation Maintenance

When working on this project, AI assistants should maintain the following documentation:

### Required Documentation Updates

1. **ROADMAP.md Status Tracking**:
   - Update PR statuses as work progresses (📋 Planned → 🚧 In Progress → ✅ Completed)
   - Keep the status current to reflect actual project state
   - Add new PRs as needed with appropriate status indicators

2. **FRESH-IDEAS.md Management**:
   - Review fresh ideas regularly for potential inclusion in roadmap
   - Update idea statuses as they are evaluated (💡 New Idea → 🔍 Under Review → ✅ Approved → 📋 Added to Roadmap)
   - Incorporate approved ideas into ROADMAP.md with proper cross-references
   - Archive implemented or obsolete ideas

3. **Documentation Sync**:
   - Keep ROADMAP.md, PR-LIST.md, and FRESH-IDEAS.md synchronized
   - Ensure any roadmap changes are reflected in the PR list
   - Link between related items across documents

4. **Case Study Source Attribution**:
   - When authoring case studies, always include verifiable sources or references
   - Link to original sources such as company blogs, press releases, case study pages, or published reports
   - If creating illustrative examples, clearly label them as "illustrative" or "hypothetical"
   - For real case studies, include:
     - Source link (e.g., "Source: [Company Name Case Study](URL)")
     - Publication or announcement date when available
     - Relevant context about where the data/results originated
   - This ensures credibility and allows readers to verify claims

### Workflow for New Features

1. Check FRESH-IDEAS.md for relevant approved ideas
2. Update roadmap with new or modified PRs
3. Update PR status indicators as work progresses
4. Cross-reference between ROADMAP.md and FRESH-IDEAS.md
5. Mark ideas as implemented when complete

These requirements ensure the project documentation stays accurate and useful for all stakeholders.
