 of your performance.

### What You'll Learn

- How to manually test your visibility across all major AI platforms
- Systematic frameworks for comprehensive and repeatable testing
- Automated tools and methods for continuous monitoring
- Query testing strategies to maximize coverage
- Quality verification techniques to ensure accuracy
- Troubleshooting approaches when visibility is lower than expected
- Best practices for documenting and analyzing test results

## Why Testing Matters

 Regular, systematic testing is the only way to verify that your AI optimization efforts are 
 paying off and that AI platforms are representing your brand accurately.

### ✅ Verify Optimization

 Confirm that your schema markup, content structure, and technical optimizations are working as intended and improving visibility.

### 🔍 Detect Issues

 Quickly identify when AI platforms misrepresent your brand, cite outdated information, or fail to mention you for key queries.

### 📊 Track Progress

 Measure improvements over time by comparing test results before and after optimization changes.

- Test on same day/time when comparing periods
- Document platform, query, date, and full response
- Note presence, position, context, and accuracy
- Capture screenshots or save responses

 4

#### Analyze Results

 Review and interpret findings:

- Calculate presence rate (% of queries mentioning your brand)
