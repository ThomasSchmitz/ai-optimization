## Introduction to Schema Markup

 Schema markup (structured data) is code that helps AI platforms understand the meaning and 
 relationships within your content. By explicitly defining entities and their properties, you 
 make it easier for AI to extract, cite, and present your information accurately.

### What You'll Learn

- How schema markup helps AI platforms understand your content
- JSON-LD format and implementation best practices
- Common schema types for products, reviews, FAQs, and articles
- Organization, LocalBusiness, and other entity schemas
- How to test and validate your schema markup
- Official Schema.org documentation and resources

 This guide focuses on JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data), the Google and 
 AI-recommended format for structured data. For general technical optimization, see our 
 [Website Technical Optimization Guide](/guides/website-optimization).

## Why Schema Markup Matters for AI

 AI platforms use schema markup to understand content without ambiguity. While AI can infer 
 meaning from context, schema provides explicit, machine-readable structure that improves 
 accuracy and citation rates.

### 🤖 AI Comprehension

 Schema eliminates ambiguity by explicitly defining entities, properties, and relationships, 
 making it easier for AI to extract accurate information.

### 📊 Rich Results

 Structured data enables rich search results (star ratings, prices, availability) which 
 AI platforms often reference when citing your content.

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

 Schema helps AI understand how entities relate to each other (e.g., product → brand → 
 manufacturer → location), improving knowledge graph accuracy.

## JSON-LD Basics

 JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is the preferred format for schema markup. 
 It's placed in a `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag, typically in the 
 `<head>` or near the relevant content.

 1
 
### Basic Structure

 Every JSON-LD object needs @context and @type:

```

{
 "@context": "https://schema.org",
 "@type": "Organization",
 "name": "Example Company",
 "url": "https://example.com"
}

```

- **@context**: Defines the vocabulary (usually Schema.org)
- **@type**: Specifies the entity type
- **Properties**: Entity-specific attributes

 2
 
### Multiple Types

 You can include multiple schema objects on one page:

```

{
 "@context": "https://schema.org",
 "@type": "Organization",
 "name": "Example Co"
}

{
 "@context": "https://schema.org",
 "@type": "Article",
 "headline": "Article Title"
}

```

 3
 
### Nested Objects

 Schema types can contain nested objects:

```
{
 "@context": "https://schema.org",
 "@type": "Product",
 "name": "Product Name",
 "brand": {
 "@type": "Brand",
 "name": "Brand Name"
 },
 "offers": {
 "@type": "Offer",
 "price": "99.99",
 "priceCurrency": "USD"
 }
}
```

## Product Schema

 Product schema is essential for e-commerce sites. It helps AI understand pricing, availability, 
 ratings, and other product details.

### Complete Product Schema Example

```

{
 "@context": "https://schema.org",
 "@type": "Product",
 "name": "Premium Organic Coffee Beans",
 "image": [
 "https://example.com/photos/product-image.jpg",
 "https://example.com/photos/product-image-2.jpg"
 ],
 "description": "100% Arabica beans, fair trade certified",
 "sku": "ABC123",
 "mpn": "925872",
 "brand": {
 "@type": "Brand",
 "name": "Example Coffee Co"
 },
 "offers": {
 "@type": "Offer",
 "url": "https://example.com/products/organic-coffee",
 "priceCurrency": "USD",
 "price": "24.99",
 "priceValidUntil": "2025-12-31",
 "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock",
 "seller": {
 "@type": "Organization",
 "name": "Example Store"
 }
 },
 "aggregateRating": {
 "@type": "AggregateRating",
 "ratingValue": "4.8",
 "reviewCount": "127"
 },
 "review": [{
 "@type": "Review",
 "reviewRating": {
 "@type": "Rating",
 "ratingValue": "5"
 },
 "author": {
 "@type": "Person",
 "name": "Jane Doe"
 },
 "reviewBody": "Excellent coffee! Rich flavor and perfect aroma."
 }]
}

```

#### Required Properties:

- **name**: Product name
- **image**: Product images (array of URLs)
- **description**: Product description
- **offers**: Price, availability, currency

#### Recommended Properties:

- **brand**: Product brand
- **aggregateRating**: Overall ratings
- **review**: Customer reviews
- **sku/mpn/gtin**: Product identifiers

## FAQ Schema

 FAQ schema helps AI understand question-answer pairs, making your content more likely to appear 
 in AI responses to user queries.

### FAQ Schema Example

```

{
 "@context": "https://schema.org",
 "@type": "FAQPage",
 "mainEntity": [{
 "@type": "Question",
 "name": "What is AI GEO?",
 "acceptedAnswer": {
 "@type": "Answer",
 "text": "AI GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing content for AI platforms like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and other AI-powered search tools."
 }
 },{
 "@type": "Question",
 "name": "Why is schema markup important for AI?",
 "acceptedAnswer": {
 "@type": "Answer",
 "text": "Schema markup provides explicit, machine-readable structure that helps AI platforms understand and accurately cite your content without ambiguity."
 }
 }]
}

```

 💡 **AI Benefit:** FAQ schema directly answers common questions, making it highly valuable for AI platforms responding to user queries.

## Article Schema

 Article schema helps AI identify and understand blog posts, news articles, and long-form content.

### Article Schema Example

```

{
 "@context": "https://schema.org",
 "@type": "Article",
 "headline": "Complete Guide to Website Technical Optimization",
 "image": [
 "https://example.com/article-image.jpg"
 ],
 "datePublished": "2025-11-18T08:00:00+00:00",
 "dateModified": "2025-11-18T09:00:00+00:00",
 "author": [{
 "@type": "Person",
 "name": "John Smith",
 "url": "https://example.com/authors/john-smith"
 }],
 "publisher": {
 "@type": "Organization",
 "name": "AI GEO",
 "logo": {
 "@type": "ImageObject",
 "url": "https://example.com/logo.png"
 }
 },
 "description": "Learn how to optimize your website's technical foundations for AI visibility."
}

```

#### Article Types:

- **Article**: General articles
- **BlogPosting**: Blog posts
- **NewsArticle**: News content
- **TechArticle**: Technical documentation

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1 Identify Schema Types

 Determine which schema types apply to your content:

- Organization/LocalBusiness for company info
- Product for e-commerce
- Article for blog content
- FAQPage for Q&A content
- Breadcrumb for navigation

### Step 2 Add JSON-LD Code

 Place schema markup in `<head>` or near relevant content:

- Use `<script type="application/ld+json">`
- Include required properties for each type
- Add recommended properties when available
- Nest related objects properly

### Step 3 Validate Schema

 Test using official validation tools:

- [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)
- [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- [Our Schema Validator Tool](/tools/schema-validator)

## Testing & Validation

 ✅

### Use Official Validators

- [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/) - Checks syntax and structure
- [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) - Tests Google eligibility
- [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) - Monitor indexed structured data

 ✅

### Common Validation Errors

- **Missing required fields**: Ensure all required properties are present
- **Invalid URLs**: Use absolute URLs, not relative paths
- **Incorrect date formats**: Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Invalid property values**: Check Schema.org docs for valid values

## Schema Markup Best Practices

 ✅

### Use Most Specific Type

 Choose the most specific schema type that applies (e.g., LocalBusiness > Organization for local businesses).

 ✅

### Keep Schema Updated

 Update schema markup when content changes (prices, availability, publish dates, etc.).

 ✅

### Match Page Content

 Schema markup must accurately reflect visible page content - don't markup content that isn't on the page.
