## What is Sigma Chat?

 Sigma Chat is an AI search engine and browsing assistant that behaves more like an 
 iterative research partner than a one-shot answer box. It keeps track of your previous 
 questions, suggests follow-ups, and can spin its findings into content drafts.

 🧭 
 
### Research-Oriented UX

 Sigma Chat is built around long-running conversations. Users start broad, then 
 narrow over time. Your brand wins visibility when your content supports the entire 
 research journey — not just a single query.

 🧩 
 
### Context Memory

 The engine remembers prior prompts and incorporates that context into subsequent 
 answers. That means consistent terminology, clear internal linking, and reusable 
 definitions on your site pay off more with each follow-up question.

 ✍️ 
 
### Content Creation Hooks

 Sigma Chat can turn research outputs into outlines, blog posts, and social content. 
 Pages that read like strong source material for content briefs are more likely to be 
 surfaced and referenced.
