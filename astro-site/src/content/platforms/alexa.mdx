## How Alexa Retrieves Information

Understanding Alexa's information sources and prioritization helps optimize your content for maximum visibility in voice search results.

### Information Sources

Alexa pulls information from multiple sources including [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), web search providers, [Amazon product data](https://www.amazon.com/), Alexa Skills, proprietary knowledge bases, and generative AI models. It prioritizes authoritative, structured data.

### Alexa Skills Priority

When users invoke a [Skill](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit) ("Alexa, ask [Skill name]"), that Skill gets priority. For general queries, Alexa uses its built-in knowledge base before suggesting Skills.

### Amazon Product Integration

For shopping queries, Alexa prioritizes Amazon product catalog data, Amazon Choice products, and items with strong reviews and Prime eligibility.

### Alexa Answer Flow

1. **User Query:** User asks Alexa a question
2. **Intent Recognition:** Alexa identifies query type (factual, shopping, skill-specific)
3. **Source Selection:** Chooses appropriate data source (Skills, Amazon catalog, web)
4. **Answer Formulation:** Constructs concise verbal response
5. **Response Delivery:** Speaks answer, may show visual on Echo Show

## Organic Answer Optimization

While Alexa Skills provide the most control, optimizing your web content can help you appear in Alexa's organic answers for relevant queries.
