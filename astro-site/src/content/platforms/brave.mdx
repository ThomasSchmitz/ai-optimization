## What is Brave AI Search?

 Brave combines a privacy-first web index with AI-generated answer summaries. 
 Instead of tracking individuals, Brave focuses on page-level relevance, 
 content quality, and user intent.

 🔍 
 
### Independent Index

 Brave Search crawls and ranks pages on its own index, rather than only 
 relaying results from other engines. Your technical SEO and content 
 quality directly impact visibility.

 🛡️ 
 
### Privacy by Default

 Brave avoids building cross-site profiles. That puts more emphasis on 
 clear on-page signals, clean markup, and honest, transparent content.

 ✨ 
 
### AI Summaries

 AI summaries surface concise answers on top of traditional results. 
 Pages that structure information cleanly are more likely to be 
 summarized and cited.
