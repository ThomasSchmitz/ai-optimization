## Gemini Integration for Google Home

In October 2025, Google launched [Gemini integration](https://blog.google/products/google-nest/gemini-for-home-launch/) for Google Home and Nest devices, transforming Google Assistant into a more conversational, context-aware AI assistant. Download the [Google Home app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app) to get started.

### Natural Conversations

Gemini enables true multi-turn conversations with context retention. Ask follow-up questions without repeating context, making interactions feel more human and intuitive.

### Smart Home Enhancement

Full Nest integration in Google Home app (v4.3+) with AI-powered notifications, natural language camera search, and smarter automation capabilities.

### Performance Boost

Google Home app is 70% faster to launch with 80% fewer crashes. Better camera feeds, real-time device status, and improved overall reliability.

### Gemini for Home Features

- **Context Retention:** Remembers conversation context across multiple turns
- **Complex Queries:** Handles sophisticated, multi-part questions
- **Troubleshooting:** Can diagnose and help solve device issues conversationally
- **Camera Intelligence:** Natural language search ("Show me when someone rang doorbell last Monday")
- **Gemini Live (Premium):** Real-time, fluid conversations (requires subscription)

### Rollout Details

**Status:** Rolling out to US users first (October 2025+), based on home addresses in Google Home app. Global expansion planned for Q1 2026.

**Pricing:** Basic Gemini features included. Advanced features (Gemini Live, enhanced automation) require Google Home Premium ($13/month standard, $26/month advanced).

## How Google Assistant Retrieves Information
