## What is Andi?

 Andi is a lightweight AI search engine that focuses on returning a single, 
 conversational result instead of a long list of links. It’s closer to an 
 “I’m Feeling Lucky" button than a full research assistant.

 🎯 
 
### Single-Answer Bias

 Andi often highlights one main answer and source. That makes the 
 competition for visibility high — but also makes winning that slot 
 disproportionately valuable.

 🧹 
 
### Minimal Interface

 The interface is intentionally simple. There are fewer visual elements 
 to showcase products or multimedia; text quality and clarity matter most.

 🧪 
 
### Experimental Feel

 As a smaller engine, Andi evolves quickly. It’s a useful sandbox for 
 testing how minimal-answer AI search engines interpret your content.

## Andi Optimization Checklist

 Use this list to validate that your “short answer" pages are ready.

### ✅ Clarity

 - Each target page starts with a direct answer.

 - Headings match the core question users ask.

 - Jargon is defined or avoided.

### ✅ Signal

 - Pages include concrete numbers or ranges where relevant.

 - Pros/cons or trade-offs are clearly listed.

 - External citations support key claims.

### ✅ Structure

 - Logical H1–H3 structure, no heading gaps.

 - Semantic lists for steps, examples, and definitions.

 - Minimal layout clutter around main content.
