          <p>
            <strong class="text-primary">AI Generative Engine Optimization (AI GEO)</strong> is the practice
            of optimizing your digital presence to appear in AI-generated responses, recommendations,
            and search results. As billions of people shift from traditional search engines to conversational
            AI assistants, your visibility in these platforms directly impacts your business growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional SEO that focuses on ranking in search engine results pages, AI GEO
            ensures your brand is mentioned, cited, and recommended when AI tools answer questions
            about your industry, products, or services.

            <p class="text-light">
              AI tools provide direct answers rather than link lists. When users ask "What's the
              best CRM for small businesses?" you want your brand in that answer—not buried in
              search results they'll never click.
