<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. List breadcrumb items in order from home to current page
2. Position numbers must be sequential (1, 2, 3, 4...)
3. Each "item" should be the full URL to that page
4. The last item is typically the current page
5. Match the breadcrumb trail visible on your page

REQUIRED FIELDS:
- @context, @type, itemListElement (array)
- Each ListItem needs: position, name, item (except optionally the last one)

SIMPLE EXAMPLE (2 levels):
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://www.yourwebsite.com"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Products",
      "item": "https://www.yourwebsite.com/products"
    }
  ]
}

DEEP HIERARCHY EXAMPLE:
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://www.yourwebsite.com"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Electronics",
      "item": "https://www.yourwebsite.com/electronics"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "Computers",
      "item": "https://www.yourwebsite.com/electronics/computers"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 4,
      "name": "Laptops",
      "item": "https://www.yourwebsite.com/electronics/computers/laptops"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 5,
      "name": "Gaming Laptops",
      "item": "https://www.yourwebsite.com/electronics/computers/laptops/gaming"
    }
  ]
}

CURRENT PAGE (LAST ITEM):
The last breadcrumb item (current page) can optionally omit the "item" URL:

{
  "@type": "ListItem",
  "position": 4,
  "name": "Current Page Title"
}

However, including the item URL is recommended for consistency.

BEST PRACTICES:
- Keep breadcrumb names short and clear
- Use the same names that appear in your visible breadcrumbs
- Don't skip levels in the hierarchy
- Ensure URLs are absolute (include https://)
- Match your site's actual navigation structure
- Update when you change site structure
- Include breadcrumbs on every page except homepage

COMMON PATTERNS:

E-commerce:
Home > Category > Subcategory > Product

Blog:
Home > Blog > Category > Post Title

Service site:
Home > Services > Service Type > Specific Service

Knowledge base:
Home > Help Center > Category > Article

BENEFITS:
- Breadcrumb trails in search results
- Better search result appearance
- Improved site navigation understanding
- Enhanced AI platform comprehension
- Better user experience signals

MOBILE OPTIMIZATION:
Breadcrumbs are especially valuable for mobile search results where they help users understand page hierarchy at a glance.

VOICE SEARCH:
Helps voice assistants understand your site structure and provide better navigational guidance.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Do not include breadcrumbs in schema if they're not visible on the page
- Position must start at 1 and increment by 1
- Names should be user-friendly, not technical URLs
- All URLs should be canonical versions
- Test with Google Rich Results Test

DYNAMIC BREADCRUMBS:
For sites with dynamic breadcrumbs, generate this schema server-side or with JavaScript to match the actual page hierarchy.
