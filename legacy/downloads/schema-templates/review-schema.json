FOR MULTIPLE REVIEWS:
Wrap individual reviews in an array:

[
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Review",
    ... first review ...
  },
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Review",
    ... second review ...
  }
]

AGGREGATE RATING:
For overall ratings across multiple reviews, use the aggregateRating in Product schema instead.

BEST PRACTICES:

- Reviews must be visible on the page
- Include both positive and negative reviews
- Respond to reviews when appropriate
